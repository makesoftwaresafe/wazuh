## Wazuh Server Docker image

This directory contains the instructions and resources used to assemble a Docker image for the Wazuh Server, which can be used as the base for other developments and projects.

> [!Note]
> The image specification corresponds to the 4.x Wazuh version and hasn't been migrated to 5.0 yet. This is work that will be carried out in https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/issues/27960. Expect further documentation and details on how it works once that issue is completed.
